	Which measurement is next ? according to the switches state 
	Delay 


Mesure of frequency:
	Low frequency with timer0 or 1 and Time Interval Counter
	High frequency with timer 2 alone, by default 
	When timer 2 is coming close to the minimum frequency it can measure then switch on the other timers
	
	whenever we need to display the result : do we have values from the 2 differents timers ? if yes, and if no overflow, just do an average of the 2 values
		

Measure of DC voltage
